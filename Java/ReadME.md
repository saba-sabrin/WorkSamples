1. The "Feature Selection" project is part of my Master thesis work. You can get a complete idea about my work from the final presentation slides which I have added here.
In this application, I have extracted the most important features related to target label. These labels are predefined for the documents used from the dataset. Each document
is attached with multiple labels. So, my goal was to build ontology for each of the labels depending on different statistical feature selection techniques such as, 

==> Correlation
==> Information Gain
==> Gain Ratio
==> Chi-Square

2. To implement this task, I have used the famous Weka library and it's API in Java language. You can get more information about Weka tool from the following link:

3. The "Natural Language Processing" folder contains code snippets used in my thesis work to process text from the input documents. For this purpose, I have used Stanford NLP Toolkit.
Extracting Nouns and pre-processing text is one of the very important aspect when working with huge data. 

There are multiple folders for extracting different type of relations between terms and concepts in the documents. I had basically two types of relation between terms extracted 
from the documents such as, Semantic and Syntactic. These were extracted depending on different heuristics and NLP techniques.
