1. The Document Frequency Analysis is part of my Master thesis work. The purpose for the frequency is simply to reduce the dimesionality of the features. As I had millions of features
extracted from a large dataset of documents. I can't disclose the dataset here because, the work has been extended and will be published soon.

2. The Smart home analysis project is solely based on statistical analysis of a large dataset mainly Big Data. The dataset has a huge number of columns and rows. The data is collected
from sensor reading from different areas of a smart-home. Different Hypothesis has been defined and tested to prove if the Null hypothesis is true or false. A correlation analysis has
been performed to understand the dependency between varioud features of the data.

A complete data analysis report is provided with the correlation analysis part just to demonstrate my knowledge in these areas.
